Team: Aryaman Gulati, Ben Eibl, Kartikeya Agarwal

Introduction:
-------------

The aim of this project was to explore the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to the creation of a new NFT collection on the blockchain. Due to the limitations of time and resources, the team generated a 'lite' version of the collection using existing crypto collections, namely Crypto Punks and Crypto Corgis.

Results:
--------

The team generated a non-extensive collection of GAN-generated NFTs, and the output was almost believable as part of the original collections. Although the style transfer did not work as well as expected in some cases, it produced some interesting outputs, such as using features from the source, such as sunglasses, on the output.


Extensions:
-----------

With more time, the team would have loved to explore other forms of GANs, such as SinGANs, to generate NFTs/images from a single image. WeÂ  would also have liked to use CycleGANs on other collections found online, but this would require obtaining an API key by setting up a digital wallet and some cryptocurrency. Finally, we considered using a similar approach to create new NFT collections from famous soccer players or paintings.
